        client_id: 'your_client_hash_at_paypal',
        client_secret: 'your_secret_hash_at_paypal',
        mode: 'sandbox' # or live to production!,
        order: { paypal: :order } # optional if you want to test with your order attrs, please refer to paypal docs to proper payload.
      }
    )
